Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to design and implement a modular agentic content generation system that takes a structured product dataset as input and autonomously generates multiple structured, machine-readable content pages.
The system must:
Operate without domain knowledge or external research
Use reusable logic blocks instead of monolithic scripts
Demonstrate clear agent boundaries and orchestration
Produce deterministic JSON outputs suitable for downstream systems
This challenge evaluates system design, agent orchestration, abstraction, and automation, not content creativity or prompt engineering.
Solution Overview
This solution implements a multi-agent automation pipeline where each agent is responsible for a single, well-defined task in the content generation lifecycle.
The system:
Parses raw product data into a clean internal model
Generates categorized user questions
Applies reusable content logic blocks
Uses a custom template engine to define page structures
Assembles complete content pages via dedicated page agents
Outputs each page as structured JSON
The design prioritizes:
Modularity
Reusability
Deterministic behavior
Clear separation of concerns
No single agent or module performs multiple responsibilities.
Scope & Assumptions
Scope
The system operates only on the provided product dataset
All generated content is derived strictly from the input data
The system generates three pages:
FAQ Page
Product Description Page
Comparison Page (with a fictional Product B)
Assumptions
Product B in the comparison page is fictional and used only for structural comparison
No external APIs, LLMs, or prompt-based systems are used
The system is designed to scale to similar product datasets with the same schema
System Design (Mandatory)
High-Level Architecture
The system follows a pipeline-based orchestration model with explicit agent handoffs.

Agent Responsibilities
1. Product Parser Agent
Converts raw product input into a normalized internal data model
Ensures consistent field naming and structure
Acts as the single source of truth for downstream agents
Input: Raw product dataset
Output: Parsed product object
2. Question Generator Agent
Automatically generates 15+ categorized user questions
Categories include:
Informational
Usage
Safety
Purchase
Comparison
Questions are deterministic and derived from product attributes
Input: Parsed product object
Output: Categorized question dictionary
3. Page Assembly Agents
Each page is generated by a dedicated agent:
a. FAQ Page Agent
Consumes categorized questions and product data
Uses the FAQ template to assemble structured Q&A pairs
Produces a machine-readable FAQ JSON page
b. Product Page Agent
Assembles product attributes, benefits, usage, and pricing
Uses reusable logic blocks to populate fields
Outputs a structured product description JSON
c. Comparison Page Agent
Compares GlowBoost with a fictional Product B
Uses a comparison logic block for structured evaluation
Outputs a clean comparison JSON
Each agent has:
A single responsibility
Explicit inputs and outputs
No shared or global state
Reusable Content Logic Blocks
Content logic blocks are pure functional modules that transform product data into structured content fragments.
Examples:
generate_benefits_block
generate_usage_block
generate_safety_block
compare_ingredients_block
These blocks:
Contain no orchestration logic
Can be reused across multiple templates or agents
Enable composability and extensibility
Template Engine Design
Templates define the structure and rules for each content page.
A template specifies:
Required fields
Formatting rules
Dependencies on logic blocks
Output structure
Templates are not responsible for data extraction or orchestration — only for structuring content.
This separation ensures:
Clean abstractions
Easy template reuse
Consistent output formats
Orchestration Flow
The system is orchestrated via a central pipeline, which:
Instantiates agents
Passes outputs explicitly from one agent to the next
Ensures deterministic execution order
Produces final JSON artifacts
The orchestration follows a DAG-style execution, avoiding message passing or hidden dependencies.
Output Structure
The final system outputs three machine-readable JSON files:
faq.json
product_page.json
comparison_page.json
Each output:
Is strictly structured
Contains no free-form text blobs
Maps cleanly from input data → logic blocks → templates → output
This makes the system suitable for integration into downstream pipelines such as search indexing, CMS ingestion, or APIs.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a production-style agentic system that emphasizes:
Clear system boundaries
Modular design
Reusable logic
Deterministic automation
Rather than relying on prompt engineering or monolithic scripts, the solution mirrors real-world applied AI system design, where clarity, maintainability, and extensibility are critical.
